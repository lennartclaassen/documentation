  Abstract                 = { In this paper a novel Polar Scan Matching (PSM) approach is described that works in the laser scanner's polar coordinate system, therefore taking advantage of the structure of the laser measurements and eliminating the need for an expensive search for corresponding points in other scan match approaches. PSM belongs to the family of point to point scan matching approaches with its matching bearing association rule. The performance of PSM is thoroughly evaluated in a simulated experiment, in experiments using ground truth, in experiments aimed at determining the area of convergence and in a SLAM experiment. All results are compared to results obtained using an iterated closest point (ICP) scan matching algorithm implementation. It is found that PSM is superior to the ICP implementation in processing speed and that PSM converges to a correct solution from a larger range of initial positions. },

The examined algorithms are based on 2d laser scans and an odometry position estimate and do not need any modifications in the environment. Due to the goals of our project an important requirement for self-localization is the ability to cope with office-like environments as well as with environments without orthogonal and rectilinear walls. Furthermore, the approaches...},
